Application level middleware are the middleware that are automatically applied to all the route in the application
for this, we will create a function with parameter (req, res, next), next() is for the exection of next route after middleware.
    const reqFilter = (req,res)=>{
        if condition setisfied
            next() // this with send to the anotehr route
        else
            send error message.
    }
    Now middleware are implemented using app.use() method as like below:
    app.use(reqFilter) // implementing middleware


Route level middleware are middleware that are applied to specified route level only
    for example:
    first we need to import router instance.
    const route = express.Router(); importing router instance

    now using route with HTTP method to use route with middleware
            example:
                route.get('/',(req,res)={
                    expression
                })
                route.get('/about',(req,res)={
                    expression
                })
                // now need to pass route to app.use() method.
                app.use('',route);
                and for route without middleware
                app.get('/',(req,res)={
                    expression
                })
